            question: "What is Kerala known for?",
            answer: `Kerala is renowned for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural diversity, all harmoniously
woven into a unique Malayali identity. Discover its beautiful beaches, including Kovalam,
Varkala, and Marari, among others. Take a scenic drive to Munnar, Wayanad, and Ponmudi
to experience the breathtaking beauty of the Western Ghats. Don’t miss the chance to visit
iconic temples, churches, and historic mosques in the Malabar region.`,
          },
          {
            question: "What should be the duration of a Kerala holiday?",
            answer: `Spending a week to ten days is perfect for exploring the highlights of Kerala, stretching
          from Kozhikode (Calicut) in the north to Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in the south.
          This timeframe allows you to fully immerse yourself in the diverse attractions and
          experiences the state has to offer.`,
          },
          {
            question: "Which is the best backwater destination in Kerala?",
            answer: `When selecting your Kerala tour package, be sure to include Kumarakom in your itinerary.
  This charming backwater escape embodies the essence of a classic Kerala postcard. Known
  for its exclusivity, Kumarakom boasts luxurious resorts along the backwaters, each with
  private jetties that allow for leisurely evening cruises on Vembanad Lake—perfect for
  catching a stunning sunset. The area’s tranquility is enhanced by vast stretches of water
  dotted with water lilies, creating a picturesque scene. Relax on your resort balcony to watch
  fishermen casting their nets or locals gliding by in wooden boats as they go about their day.
  Kumarakom is lush, atmospheric, and offers a unique sense of calm.`,
          },
          {
            question: "What is the best season to visit Kerala?",
            answer: `The best time to visit Kerala is from October to March, when the weather is pleasantly
cool and dry. These months are ideal for exploring Kerala’s beaches, backwaters, and hill
stations, with temperatures ranging between 24°C and 30°C (75°F to 86°F). This season also
sees various cultural festivals like Onam and Thrissur Pooram, adding a vibrant touch to the
experience. For travelers interested in the monsoon charm, June to September is perfect, with
lush green landscapes and rejuvenating Ayurvedic treatments available at this time. However,
be prepared for heavy rain, which can limit some outdoor activities.`,
          },
          {
            question: "Is it okay to visit Kerala in the monsoon?",
            answer: `Kerala’s monsoon season lasts from July to September, a time when outdoor activities
slow down, beaches are quiet, and many attractions and local shops close temporarily.
However, for those drawn to the charm of rain-washed backwaters, late September can be a
good time to visit, as the heaviest rains begin to ease, revealing Kerala’s lush, green
landscapes in their monsoon splendor.`,
          },
          {
            question: "What is a great honeymooning destination in Kerala?",
            answer: `Kumarakom’s backwaters provide an idyllic escape for honeymooning couples, with the
majestic Vembanad Lake adding vivid sunsets and enhancing the picturesque setting. While
Munnar is also a charming destination for couples, the backwaters of Kumarakom offer a
uniquely tranquil experience, with serene countryside views and the gentle murmur of water
creating a peaceful atmosphere perfect for a romantic retreat.`,

We will land in Port Blair where many historically valuable documents and structures are left behind to remind us of the independence fights locals faced here. From Port Blair, we’ll head out on a boat ride to Havelock Island, a barely known island which appeal is in the gorgeous view paired with the tranquil atmosphere. It’s around 54 kms away from Port Blair and sees many divers visit here for the calm, clearwater with 40m visibility underwater. Even beginners will love the experience here thanks to the slow current and the varied species they can see. We’ll visit the famous Radhanagar Beach, the arguably, one of the best beaches of Asia and by visiting here, you’ll understand yourself why. `,
