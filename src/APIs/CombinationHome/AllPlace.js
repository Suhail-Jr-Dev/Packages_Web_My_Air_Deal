And summer is definitely the best time to be here, experience the most out of the beach by taking part in the activities and do some island hopping around here. We will land in Port Blair where many historically valuable documents and structures are left behind to remind us of the independence fights locals faced here. From Port Blair, we’ll head out on a boat ride to Havelock Island, a barely known island which appeal is in the gorgeous view paired with the tranquil atmosphere. It’s around 54 kms away from Port Blair and sees many divers visit here for the calm, clearwater with 40m visibility underwater. Even beginners will love the experience here thanks to the slow current and the varied species they can see. We’ll visit the famous Radhanagar Beach, the arguably, one of the best beaches of Asia and by visiting here, you’ll understand yourself why. `,
